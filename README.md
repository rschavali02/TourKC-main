# TourKC
 
FBLA Coding and Programming App

Purpose
We built TourKC to promote tourism in the Kansas City area. TourKC does this by presenting 50 great attractions in a simple, accesible, and dynamic way.

Installation with Xcode
TourKC app can be installed on any iOS device by connecting the device to a Mac running Xcode. Clone this repository, and open it in Xcode. Select the destination device in the run menu (at the top of the window next to the run button, reading iPhone X by default), then click run. This will make a temporary installation of the app on the device. Occassionally, it will ask for a "Developer Team." This will require the installer to log in with their Apple ID.

Usage
Upon launching TourKC, the user will see TourKC's home screen, which consists of a spotlight of featured attractions and all 50 attractions divided into categories. Clicking the search button in the upper-lefthand corner of the screen, the user brings out a sidebar where they can filter the attractions by name, category, or other characteristics.

When selecting an attraction, the user is taken to a detail screen with specific information about the attraction. In this view, the attracion is placed on a map, and the user can read a brief description of the location, follow a link to the location's website, or explore recommendations of similar attractions. The user can also use the favorite button to save certain attractions for later.
